    <h2>The New Goal</h2>
    <p>In many ways, the new goal is the old goal: don't imitate, understand! In the age of AI, deep understanding is more important than ever.</p>
    <p>But I'm adding a new goal, to <strong>Fight Skill Atrophy</strong>. LLMs make it far too easy to lose your hard-won skills. We'll fight together to keep your skills strong, and add AI skills to them.</p>
    <p>Another goal is to <strong>Connect With Real Humans</strong>. I've been so enjoying one-on-one coaching with students, and I realized that I want to connect more directly with all of you.</p>
    <p>Plus I discovered that devs who believe in "don't imitate, understand" all these years should be talking to each other! So many like-minded devs who believe in the importance of understanding!</p>
    <p>Connecting with real people in the age of false LLM interaction, is vital to doing quality work, and keeping your job prospects healthy.</p>
    <p>An All-Access Membership is designed to help you achieve these goals. Come join us!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What about the courses I've purchased?</h3>
    <p>You own them for life, whether you have a subscription or not! And you'll still be able to purchase courses for lifetime access.</p>
    <p>But a membership gets you access to <em>everything</em> as long as you are subscribed, plus all the other benefits listed above.<p>
    <h3>What are some upcoming courses?</h3>
    <p>A new course on <em>AI-Assisted Software Development</em> is coming in December, followed by a course on <em>The Web Platform</em>, where we learn how to avoid frameworks using LLMs and use features provided in the browser to build awesome web apps.</p>
    <p>Other courses will be announced in 2026, and you'll get a chance to help guide the direction of the year.</p>
    <h3>The Founding Member price really won't go up?</h3>
    <p>No, it won't, as long as you stay subscribed. That means you save money on new courses every year, plus get all the other benefits. I'm aiming to make this an unbeatable continuing education deal.</p>
    <h3>Is there PPP Pricing?</h3>
    <p>Yes, but it is higher than other PPP offerings in the past, due to the value being provided. Please <a href="all-access-ppp">fill out the PPP request form</a> with details.</p>
    <h3>What is the Cascade AI Workshop?</h3>
    <p>A 90-minute workshop where you will learn about Cascade Methodology, a replacement for Agile/Scrum that I've been implementing successfully for 20 years, now augmented for AI-assisted development.</p>
    <p>You'll learn to "why down" features into problem statements, conduct MSP (Minimum Solved Problem) releases (instead of MVP), and decompose tasks in a way that provide good context for AI and get the best possible output from LLM code generation.</p>
    <p>Dates are coming soon for January 2026.</p>
    <h3>How do I subscribe?</h3>
    <p>You can <a href="https://dontimitateunderstand.com/purchase?product_id=6503833">become a founding member</a> now, locking in your subscription price for life.</p>
