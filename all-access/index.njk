<h1>All-Access<br />Mentorship</h1>
</section>
<section>
    <p>In the age of AI, companies are hiring less junior developers. Maximizing long-term job prospects means going beyond just being a dev that closes tickets.</p>
    <p>I'm so excited to present a new unique opportunity, and a new way to learn with me, and grow as a developer.</p>
    <p>This isn't about learning to code. It's about <strong>gaining the deep technical understanding and missing skills necessary to go from dev to architect and lead.</strong></p>
    <p>Introducing the new <b><i>All-Access Mentorship</i></b> subscription. Join now to lock in Founding Member pricing that will never go up as long as you're subscribed.</p>

    <h2>From Dev to Architect/Lead</h2>
    <p>How do you go beyond being a dev that closes tickets, and grow into an architect, dev lead, or product lead?</p>
    <p>Most devs got help via tutorials and courses when first starting out. But there is a lack of help to take you the rest of the way, to architect and lead. Yet that is exactly who is thriving in the LLM age, guiding both devs and AI to build quality software.</p>
    <p>I've been a dev lead, product lead, and software architect for decades. I know what it takes. All-Access Mentorship is about helping you get there.</p>
    <p>From deep technical understanding and fighting AI skill atrophy, to architectural principles, to communication, management, leadership, making convincing arguments, and more.</p>
    <p>Join the community, attend the monthly round table with others who believe in "don't imitate, understand", and get courses as they release for the deep understanding necessary to ace that interview, make the hard choices, and advance your career.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What about the courses I've purchased?</h3>
    <p>You own them for life, whether you have a subscription or not! And you'll still be able to purchase courses for lifetime access.</p>
    <p>But a membership gets you access to <em>everything</em> as long as you are subscribed, plus all the other benefits listed above.<p>
    <h3>What are some upcoming courses?</h3>
    <p>A new course on <em>AI-Assisted Software Development</em> is coming in December, followed by a course on <em>The Web Platform</em>, where we learn how to avoid frameworks using LLMs and use features provided in the browser to build awesome web apps.</p>
    <p>Other courses will be announced in 2026, and you'll get a chance to help guide the direction of the year.</p>
    <h3>The Founding Member price really won't go up?</h3>
    <p>No, it won't, as long as you stay subscribed. That means you save money on new courses every year, plus get all the other benefits. I'm aiming to make this an unbeatable continuing education deal.</p>
    <h3>Is there PPP Pricing?</h3>
    <p>Yes, but it is higher than other PPP offerings in the past, due to the value being provided. Please <a href="https://dontimitate.dev/ppp-request">fill out the PPP request form on dontimitate.dev</a> with details.</p>
    <h3>What is the Cascade AI Workshop?</h3>
    <p>A 90-minute workshop where you will learn about Cascade Methodology, a replacement for Agile/Scrum that I've been implementing successfully for 20 years, now augmented for AI-assisted development.</p>
    <p>You'll learn to "why down" features into problem statements, conduct MSP (Minimum Solved Problem) releases (instead of MVP), and decompose tasks in a way that provide good context for AI and get the best possible output from LLM code generation.</p>
    <p>Dates are coming soon for January 2026.</p>
    <h3>How do I subscribe?</h3>
    <p>You can <a href="https://dontimitateunderstand.com/purchase?product_id=6503833">become a founding member</a> now, locking in your subscription price for life.</p>
