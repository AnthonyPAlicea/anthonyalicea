## The Challenge

An international nonprofit organization relied on software used across many countries, but had no budget to hire UX designers. The existing team was small, the need was large, and the volunteers available had no UX background. I needed a way to grow both a research team and a design team from scratch, using only the people and time I had.

The question wasn't just "how do I train people in UX." It was: how do I build a system that keeps producing capable UX practitioners after I step back?

## The Insight

The best foundation for usability instincts is a combination of strong mental models built via good theory coupled with *watching real people struggle with real software*. Someone who has observed dozens of usability tests develops an intuition for what works and what doesn't. Engaging in research also enables a new person to quickly make contributions to the team. Thus, that observation-first principle became the backbone of the entire pipeline.

I proposed a four-stage training framework to leadership, framed as both a way to build a user research team and a pipeline for developing future UX designers.

## Stage 1: User Research -- Build Instincts Through Observation

<div class="theme-img theme-img--sm">
  <img src="/assets/portfolio/ux-trainers/train1.png" alt="Stage 1: User Research -- Observe users, conduct interviews, build instincts, watch people use software." class="theme-img--light">

</div>

Every new team member started here, regardless of their background. Before learning any UX principles, they observed. They watched usability tests. They sat in on interviews. They learned the software not by reading documentation, but by watching real users interact with it.

This stage was deliberately first. When someone has watched a user struggle through a task for ten minutes, the heuristic that explains *why* it's a problem lands completely differently. Observation gives theory something to stick to.

Alongside observation, new team members were trained on research discipline from the start: how to avoid leading questions, how not to bias participants, and how to stay neutral during sessions. I also worked with stakeholders across the organization to establish a reliable process for recruiting representative users for research, so that every test the team ran reflected real usage patterns rather than convenience samples.

## Stage 2: UX Training -- Structured Learning with Coaching

<div class="theme-img theme-img--sm">

</div>

Once team members had a foundation of real-world observation, they moved into structured learning. This stage included required reading drawn from Nielsen Norman Group curriculum and established UX literature, paired with tech talks and hands-on workshops.

I designed workshops that put learning into practice immediately. One example: a design studio workshop where team members role-played as stakeholders and designers, working through problem framing exercises together. This kind of active learning helped bridge the gap between understanding a concept and knowing how to apply it in a real project with real organizational pressures.

Each person in this stage was paired with an experienced team member for 1-on-1 coaching. The pairing wasn't informal. It was a structured arrangement with clear expectations for both sides, so that learning was consistent and no one fell through the cracks.

## Stage 3: Embedded UXer -- Real Work on Real Teams

<div class="theme-img theme-img--sm">
  <img src="/assets/portfolio/ux-trainers/train3.png" alt="Stage 3: Embedded UXer -- Standalone designer on product teams, cross-functional work." class="theme-img--light">

</div>

The goal of the pipeline was never academic knowledge. It was to produce people who could do the work independently. In Stage 3, trained team members were placed on product teams as standalone UX designers, working cross-functionally with developers and stakeholders.

This transition didn't happen without support. I paired new embeds with experienced UXers for an overlap period, so they had a safety net while taking on real responsibility. I reviewed designs with new embeds regularly during this stage, giving direct feedback on their work and helping them navigate the practical challenges of being the only designer on a product team.

The outcome: volunteers who started with no UX background were now functioning as independent designers, making real decisions on real products used across multiple countries.

## Stage 4: Train Others -- Scale the Practice

<div class="theme-img">
  <img src="/assets/portfolio/ux-trainers/train4.png" alt="Stage 4: Train Others -- Mentor new researchers, teach UX training, scale the practice." class="theme-img--light">
  <img src="/assets/portfolio/ux-trainers/train4_dark.png" alt="Stage 4: Train Others -- Mentor new researchers, teach UX training, scale the practice." class="theme-img--dark">
</div>

The final stage is what makes the system self-sustaining. Experienced UXers who came through the pipeline became mentors and trainers for the next cohort. They didn't just "help out." They took ownership of onboarding and coaching new team members.

To support this, I created instructional materials and pairing guidelines specifically focused on core UX activities like cognitive walkthroughs and heuristic analysis. These materials gave mentors a consistent foundation for teaching, so the quality of training didn't depend on any single person's availability or style.

This is the feedback loop. Stage 4 feeds back into Stage 2: each generation of trained UXers becomes the teaching infrastructure for the next. The system no longer depends on me. It runs today, years after I built it, continuing to bring in people with no UX background and develop them into capable practitioners who then train others.

## What This Taught Me

Building this pipeline over seven years reinforced something I now consider central to effective UX education: the sequence matters as much as the content. Starting with observation before theory, pairing structured learning with active coaching, supporting the transition to independent work, and then turning practitioners into teachers -- each stage exists in that order for a reason. Rearranging them would undermine the whole system.

It also taught me that the hardest part of scaling education isn't creating good material. It's designing systems where other people can teach effectively without you in the room. The instructional materials, pairing guidelines, and recorded training sessions I built weren't just documentation. They were the mechanism that made the pipeline repeatable.

Over 30 people have moved through this framework. Several who entered with zero UX experience are now experienced designers and active mentors. The pipeline is still running today.
