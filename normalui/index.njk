<p><b>You don't need to be a designer to make a web app easier to use.</b></p>
<p>Over the last 20 years as both a developer and UX designer, I've developed a technique that non-designers can use to improve the usability of the web apps they build.</p>
<p>I've used the technique in the design and construction of many apps with thousands of users and hundreds of usability tests with real people from all walks of life. The technique always works.</p>
<p>In this book, a fast read with lots of examples, you'll quickly learn the technique and be able to immediately apply it to your work. I call it Normal UI.</p>

  <h2>Who Is This Book For?</h2>
  <p>This book is for you if you are:</p>

    <li>A developer building web applications.</li>
    <li>A designer who has more expertise on making web apps look good, but less on making them work well.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If either of these are you, then this book is designed for you and your team.
