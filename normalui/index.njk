        <h2>Common Usability Pitfalls</h2>
        <p>After 25 years of building web apps and running thousands of usability tests, I've watched the same patterns repeat:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Developers without design support</strong> rely on component libraries and templates, assuming they guarantee good UX.</li>
            <li><strong>Teams with designers</strong> often focus only on visual appearance, not user behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-generated interfaces</strong> create functional but sometimes confusing user experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Beautiful buttons</strong> go unnoticed because users don't understand what they do.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using a premium UI component library doesn't guarantee your app is usable. You can have the most elegant code and stunning visuals, but if users can't complete their tasks, your app will fail.</p>
        <p><strong>In the age of AI-generated code, successful web apps are usable web apps.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h2>Introducing Normal UI: A Framework For Designers and Non-Designers Alike</h2>
        <p>Normal UI is a practical, learnable system that helps developers and designers make better usability decisions without requiring deep UX expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>The core concept is simple:</strong> Think of your user workflows like database normalization.</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Normalized workflows</strong> spread tasks across multiple focused screens, reducing cognitive load</li>
            <li><strong>Denormalized workflows</strong> keep users on fewer screens for efficiency with familiar tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The benefits appear when you know which approach to use when.</p>

    <figcaption>Denormalized workflow on the left, normalized workflow on the right.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Plus you don't need to be a designer. If you can draw boxes, circles (not perfect ones), and triangles, you can use Normal UI. Or draw in popular tools like FigJam.</p>

</figure>

        <h3>Why Add Normal UI To Your Design Process?</h3>
        <p><strong>✅ It's unifies your team around a methodology</strong><br>
        Designers and devs can both use the same terminologies and understand what is needed. Normal UI improves your team's communication and cohesion on software projects.</p>
        
        <p><strong>✅ It's AI-teachable</strong><br>
        You can guide AI code generation with specific workflow concepts, preventing the "fast code, bad UX" trap. You give an LLM the same terminology your team uses, and it knows what kind of UI workflows to generate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>✅ It improves code quality</strong><br>
        Normalized workflows often lead to cleaner architecture, better accessibility, and improved performance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>✅ It works</strong><br>
        Proven across hundreds of real-world usability tests over two decades.</p>

        <h2>Perfect for the AI Development Era</h2>
        <p>Normal UI is a powerful compaion to AI-assisted development:</p>
        <p><strong>Guide AI with precision:</strong> Instead of asking for "a user dashboard," specify "a normalized checkout workflow" or "a denormalized filtering interface" and get consistent, usable results.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevent AI usability pitfalls:</strong> AI excels at generating functional components but doesn't understand when dangerous workflows (like sending mass emails) need to be slowed down across multiple confirmation steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Scale your UX impact:</strong> Teach AI the Normal UI framework once, then apply it consistently across all your projects.</p>

        <h2>Why "Normal" UI?</h2>
        <p>The name comes from database normalization, a concept most developers already understand. Just as you can normalize or denormalize data structures, you can normalize or denormalize user interfaces.</p>
        <p>This familiar metaphor makes the framework immediately accessible to developers while providing a shared language for discussing usability decisions with designers and stakeholders.</p>
