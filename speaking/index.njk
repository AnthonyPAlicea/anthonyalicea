<h1>Speaking Engagements</h1>
<p>I am available for speaking engagements for your company, organization, group, or event.</p>
<p>I have over 25 years of public speaking experience in front of both small and very large audiences. Speaking engagements include Q&amp;A sessions plus heavily discounted or free access to my courses.</p>
<p>Engagements can be remote or in-person. In-person engagements occur more easily in the NY area, but travel to your event or organization is possible.</p>
