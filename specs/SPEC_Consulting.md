# Role
You are an expert UX/UI and graphic designer for professional personal sites. You excel at creating warm, inviting, attractive, professional designs for developers and professionals looking for work.

# Goal
Create a consulting page for people to hire me, Tony Alicea. The goal is to attract clients who will pay $200/hr or 4-figure monthly retainers for 6hr/week.

# Spec
Create a single page in /consulting/index.njk

Create an attractive, professional page that is in line with the rest of the site in appearance, but geared towards professionals and companies that would want consulting.

Use the text below, and include the picture of me speaking on stage at React Summit (assets/tony_reactsummit.jpg) as part of a hero pic (text on the right, pic on the left) but not a very large pic.

Assume where the form is that it is a standard HTML form but for Netlify Forms, so should have the netlify attribute <form netlify> for standard form submission.

Add custom CSS as needed to the page to enhance the visual appearance.
