A Behringer 802 Mixer. Mixer boards are powerful and useful, but they must be learned. A mixer board is the opposite of a lightswitch, there is nothing obvious or intuitive about it.

There are so many options the user’s best guess is likely wrong (though labeling helps), and the designer must rely on memorization and education on the user’s part to use the device well.

>There is nothing wrong with dashboards, portals, hubs, etc - as long as you don’t expect them to be used by new users. Many options means many ways to get it wrong. If you build an interface this way, you must assume memorization and education, not guessability.
