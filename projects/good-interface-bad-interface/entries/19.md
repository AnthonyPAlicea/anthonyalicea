Simple garage door opener. It does one thing well. There is a single button, and an indicator providing feedback. However it is also extremely easy to click the extruded button.

Time and again I find myself accidentally opening or closing the garage (sometimes with myself in it). So much so that I periodically check that the garage door is closed.
