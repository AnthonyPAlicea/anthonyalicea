My toaster oven. Top dial when in the ‘off’ position means oven is off, but toaster is on. The bottom two individually control toast versus oven.

Many a time I have left the toaster thinking it was toasting, when it was in oven position, or vice versa. The toaster ticks, but I return to find no heat, no ready food.
