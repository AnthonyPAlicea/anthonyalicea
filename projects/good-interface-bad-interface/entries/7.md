Panel on a Keurig coffee brewer. Turn it on, main screen says ‘Ready to Brew’, and you choose one of 3 cup sizes. There are no labels, but the clarity of icons and reduction of options makes it self-evident.

>Normally labels are needed on icons. However (if the icons are extremely clear, agree with the context, and the interface’s goal is self-evident and highly focused) labels aren’t always necessary.
