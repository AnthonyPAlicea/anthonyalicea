Walmart. Primary sections, sub sections, and sale areas are clearly marked – yet you still have to stumble around to figure out where you are in relation to everything else.

If you were suddenly transported to a spot like this in the middle of a Walmart, would you know how to get to Electronics?

If you watch people’s user experience at a Walmart, there’s a lot of neck craning, searching for signs of where to go.

Better: Subtle markers pointing to other areas visible from any point in the store.
