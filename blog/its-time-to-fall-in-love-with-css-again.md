Multiple generations of front-end developers have never learned HTML and CSS properly. Instead they jumped straight into component-based JavaScript frameworks, and quickly decided that CSS was bad. This was an understandable reaction, though, because CSS was originally designed to style complete documents, not small reusable pieces of documents.

Developers, then, introduced a myriad of abstractions on top of CSS, designed to mesh with their JS component universe. They never gained a proper mental model of CSS, and did no work to understand why it works the way it does, or why decades ago it was the clear winner of the possible approaches to styling marked-up documents. CSS became the object of memes and jokes in the JavaScript front-end dev community. This isn't surprising, after all what you don't understand you make fun of.

However something wonderful has happened in the ensuing years. While the JavaScript ecosystem has grown ever more complex, the people building browsers and designing new CSS features have made CSS ever more a pleasure to use, and have kept the JS component creators clearly in mind. 

As a result, the JavaScript developer mindset that "CSS is bad" is now dramatically outdated. CSS is for everyone, whether making websites or reusable JS-based components. It's time for front-end devs to fall in love with CSS all over again. Let's talk about why.

## Why Devs First Fell In Love With CSS

## Documents vs Reusable Components

## Abstractions Over CSS

### Preprocessors

### Scoped Styles

### CSS-in-JS

### Tailwind

## Web Designers, Art, and Reality

If an architect handed a builder designs for a building that wouldn't work according to the laws of physics, it won't be the builder's fault that the project ends up being stressful, over-budget, and results in something that doesn't quite match the design.

If you, the dev, spend most of your CSS time fighting to make something look like the prototype in all supported browsers, and the design is from someone that doesn't know anything about CSS, it isn't surprising that you transfer your frustration to CSS itself. But in these cases the problem isn't CSS, the problem is the prototype.
