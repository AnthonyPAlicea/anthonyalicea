Social media has become a reminder of something precious we are losing in the age of LLMs: **unique voices**.

Over time, it has become obvious just how many posts are being generated by an LLM. The tell is the voice. Every post sounds like it was posted by the same social media manager.

If you rely on an LLM to write all your posts, you are making a mistake.

Your voice is an asset. Not just what you want to say, but how you say it.

Your voice is unique. It is formed from your lifetime of lived experiences. No one's voice will be exactly like yours.

Your voice becomes recognizable. Over many posts it becomes something people subconsciously connect with, recognize, trust, and look forward to.

Your voice provides the framework for the impression you leave in a job interview, while networking at a meet-up, or with a co-worker.

Years ago I got a job thanks to my blog posts. A manager wanted my voice influencing their organization. Your voice is an asset.

Your voice matures and becomes even more unique with time and practice.

LLMs can rob you of that voice, and the rest of us lose something precious in the process.

Having an LLM write "in your voice" is not the same. Your voice is not static. It changes with the tides of your life and state of mind. Your most impactful message may come because it was the right moment and you were in the right frame of mind.

Let your voice grow with use. Let it be unique.

Do not let one of your greatest assets fade into atrophy, wilted by cognitive laziness.

Write in <em>your</em> voice.

I do not care what the linguistic remix machine juggles into being. 

I care what you have to say.
