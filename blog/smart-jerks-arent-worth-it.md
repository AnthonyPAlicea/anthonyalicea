Myths proliferate in every culture. Some are harmless. Some are not. The myth of the "difficult genius" is perhaps one of the most harmful myths that still exist in software development today.

Your software is hurt by toxic personalities on your team. Smart jerks aren't worth it. Let's dispel the myth.

## The Myth of the Difficult Genius
The myth of the "difficult genius" is not unique to software development. The myth itself proliferates in part because of famously difficult-to-deal-with scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and more throughout history.

A steady diet of books, movies, and pop culture have taught us that great things are accomplished by jerks and the people who tolerate them. This has been true.

It is *also* true that great things have been accomplished by well-functioning cohesive teams of people who respected each other. That, however, isn't seen as fodder for great storytelling (who wants to watch or read about a team getting along).

The important question is: <strong>which one do you want your software team to resemble?:</strong> 

1) "The jerk and those who tolerate them"? <i>Or...</i>
2) "The cohesive team that accomplishes great things"?

## What Is A Jerk?
Communication styles differ for many reasons: cultural, experiential, and physical. The intent here is not to label every person that we come into conflict with as a "jerk".

However, there is such a thing as toxic behavior. In the "difficult genius" tolerated by a dev team, that behavior can often be labeled as "obnoxiously aggressive". I borrow that term from the video that inspired this blog post, delivered by my friend Jamie Smyth from <a href="https://thesmythgroup.com">The Smyth Group</a>.

You can find the original video below, and <strong>I encourage you to stop right now and watch it</strong>. It's only 2 minutes long, but contains so much truth in such a short amount of time. It also gives good examples of what we're talking about when we say someone is acting like a jerk.

Let's define the term "jerk" here as someone who is both <em>intentionally</em>, and <em>obnoxiously</em> aggressive. Aggressive in their enforcement of their own opinions and dismissive of others'. Obnoxious in the frequency of unnecessary negative interactions with them. Intentional in that they understand their behavior is aggressive, and choose not to adjust it.

Ultimately, you know you're dealing with someone who is acting like a jerk by how you feel after interacting with them. If most interactions leave you feeling emotionally exhausted, dismissed, belittled, or angry, you may be dealing with toxic behavior on your team.

Toxic behavior is ruinous both to software and the devs who build it. But it's often excused.

## The Excuses
There are various excuses teams give themselves for tolerating toxic behavior. These excuses are wrong.

### They're The Only Ones Who...

### They Produce

### They're Logical

### They're Brilliant

## The Impact

## Prevention
If you and your team are already dealing with a "difficult genius" (i.e. smart jerk), then dealing with the problem within the organizational structure may end up being necessary. Whether that's trying to help the person to change their behavior, or deciding they aren't a good fit for the team.

Beyond that, you should be interested in <em>prevention</em>. We need to find the right people to work with. Plus we should learn how to best interact with our team members, and ensure that <em>we</em> aren't acting like a jerk!

### Finding Brilliant People Who Are Nice to Work With
We all want to work with smart people. They produce good work and we improve as we learn things from them. But, for best results, we also need those people to be nice to work with.

Finding those people is not easy. At times, there is a degree of 'taking a chance'. In other cases it's a matter of recommendations from people you trust. There's also the care involved in your organization's hiring practices.

What I can at least do, is give you a recommendation. The folks at <a href="https://thesmythgroup.com">The Smyth Group</a> who made the video referenced earlier are both brilliant *and* nice to work with.

They build custom software, train or bolt on to your existing dev team, and provide an array of useful dev team <a href="https://thesmythgroup.com/services/advisory/">advisory services</a>.

Reach out to me at <a href="mailto:talicea@thesmythgroup.com">talicea@thesmythgroup.com</a> to get in touch. I'm their <a href="https://thesmythgroup.com/people/tony-alicea/">director of education</a>.

### Not Being a Jerk
We also need to learn how to improve team dynamics and work with the people around us, but devs generally aren't given that education. We need to avoid being the jerk ourselves, and learn how to best communicate and interact with our team members, within the unique environment that is a dev team.

Since that education is sorely lacking, I made a course. It's <a href="https://teamdynamics.dev">Team Dynamics and Soft Skills for Developers.</a> I put my 25 years of dev, management, tech education, and interpersonal communication training into a it. I think you and your team will find it useful.

## Teams Are People
Dev teams are a collection of people. People need dignity and respect. Smart jerks injure that basic need within your team dynamic. They hurt your team and your software. Help them or decide they aren't a fit for your team. Either way, don't tolerate them.

They aren't worth it.
