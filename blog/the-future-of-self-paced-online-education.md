A lot of words have been dedicated to how LLMs are changing the landscape of software development. But there's another arena that has been massively impacted by the rise of AI and deserves more discussion: the self-paced online education industry.

Thousands upon thousands of developers are self-taught, and that self-taught education, for many, included self-paced video courses. The student appetite for inexpensive (compared to universities) video course education powered the success of marketplaces and platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Teachable and more.

However, the past few years have seen a massive disruption of that success. This AI disruption is leaving the industry and learners with some open vital questions: What is the value of a video course when you seemingly can ask an interactive LLM to teach you anything? Are LLMs the right answer to a good education for developers? What will the next generation of self-paced learning look like?

## Bona Fides
I've been a developer educator building self-paced video courses for over a decade. I released my first web development course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/anthonypalicea" target="_blank">Udemy</a> in late 2014.

Leading up to that, I found nearly all video courses, even popular ones, to be nothing but "follow along with me while I code"-style videos, which did not provide the mental models and understanding necessary to debug well and support a long career. I wanted to provide web development education for self-taught devs that was rooted in first-principles and computer science (I got a comp sci degree 25 years ago).

The results shocked me. To date I have over 370,000 enrolled students and I've heard from many students that my most well-known course, <a href="https://dontimitate.dev/courses/javascript-weird-parts/" target="_blank">JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts</a>, was the foundation of their career.

Over the years interacting with so many students, I've seen the challenges they face, the curricula that work, and what doesn't. Like many other instructors, I rode the wave of interest in inexpensive education, enjoyed watching students succeed from all backgrounds and economic circumstances, and was able to support myself and family doing it.

Then, in 2014, something changed.
